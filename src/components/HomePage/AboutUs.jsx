            <p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Namma Gaadi website facilitates farmers. Our goal is to bridge the gap between Farmers and the Market.<br />Right time, Right Place, Right truck.<br />Struggling farmers can book their truck hassle free fulfilling their needs. It connects them with the transport service providers, providing a wide range of trucks and tractor trolleys, and also allows posting the requirements of part-load as well as full-load. The requestor can view the responses to their posted loads and connects them offline too with the transporters to finalise the deal and can provide a rating for the transporter once the trip is completed. Creating a wow experience to the customers as well as our driver, remains our ultimate goal over all.</p>
